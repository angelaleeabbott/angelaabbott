    <p>My favorite beverage is Hojicha tea. It's a Japanese green tea made from roasting green tea leaves. Its flavor is very unique. It has a very rich, earthy taste. There are different strengths, but generally all green teas are steeped for no more than 2 minutes, otherwise you will risk burning the leaves too much, which gives the tea a bitter taste. I recommend enjoying Hojicha both hot or cold - they are lovely at each temperature!</p>
